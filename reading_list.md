# Elixir
## [Programming Elixir â‰¥ 1.6: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun - Dave Thomas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40224740-programming-elixir-1-6)

The book where I started with Elixir.

The style is simple, and the approach is a balance between practical hands-on and more theoretical concepts.
Considering that it refers to Elixir 1.6, the reader might want to go deeper and understanding what changed with the most recent releases but other concepts like fundamentals of data structure and OTP are still valid.

Together with [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/en/) is an excellent Elixir learner resource.

## [Metaprogramming Elixir - Chris McCord](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24791466-metaprogramming-elixir)

Who better than [Chris](http://www.chrismccord.com/) can show us the power of Metaprogramming in Elixir?

As the author, I think too that metaprogramming is an important element of every modern language because it allows the programmer to heavily reduce code duplication
and write beautiful and expressive DSLs.

But metaprogramming is also dangerous and, like everything similar, decent knowledge can help us preventing disastrous conseguences.

It's a small book that can be read in a bunch of days, around 100 pages, and that is an additional reason for adding it to every Elixir library.

# Devops

## [The Google SRE book](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/)

In the next future, the word Devops will be more and more associated with Site Reliability Engineer and this book is the fundamentals of it.
The idea of a developer with attention to system maintenance and reliability over the "omni-powerful sysadmins team" is gaining popularity more and more and this book puts
the basis of it.

It's free, it's well written, just give it a look.

# Humanity

## [Drive - Daniel H. Pink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive)
![Book Cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348931599l/6452796.jpg)

A nice little book with many insights on what motivates us as humans and on the importance of reaching that state of the mind known as [Flow](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/flow).

Nothing shocking or unexpected for someone who works in the software industry as developer, as we all are well aware of the blessing of concentration and the frustration of losing it, but a nice reading for having some argument to explain it.

Particularly useful the second part of the book, "The Type I Toolkit"
