title: "Remote journal - A year after"
---

I had occasions to share and discuss with multiple people and in multiple occasions about [Why remote daily sucks - Try remote journal]({% post_url 2022-09-02-Daily-Journal %}) and I've received many interesting feedbacks and questions.

Also considering that is more than a year that my team and I have adopted the remote journal approach, I thought it would be a good occasion for collecting some of the questions that I've received and try to make the point on the tool.

## How do you keep people connected if they don't see each others anymore during the daily?

This concern was present also at the introduction of the remote journal but wasn't ever connected specifically with the removal of the remote daily itself but with the whole remote working approach.

I also understand that for some, the daily can be an occasion for meeting the team and seeing the human beings behind the messaging system names.

For that reason we introduced the developers-only chat and a recurrent "co-working call".

The first, as suggested in the original post, worked amazingly not only as a place to communicate with the rest of the team but also as a safe space for expressing "humanity", the nuance that some value so much in the remote daily.

### Co-working call

The second is something that I've not talked about and can be resumed with "a daily, optional meeting that happens every morning for the whole morning and where everyone is invited".

The original idea was to have a virtual equivalent of "the water cooler" or "coffee machine" where people could feel free to just chit chat and connect.

After less than a week it was just skipped by everyone and instead became the place where we could informally discuss between us and handle anything that should be handled in a synchronous way.

I think it partly achieved its goal of being an informal space because often product discussions also involved the culture behind decisions and team feelings.

Also not having a definite time also helped in keeping things spontaneous.

Together with team's chat and co-working call, we also tried to adopt more regularly occasions for doing pair or mob programming but, even if they happened, they were too rare for really helping building the connection.

So after one year of experiments, my conclusion is that, by working remotely, you can build a "good enough" team culture but it will never replace the full "in the office" experience.

And I think [that's fine]({% post_url 2023-02-13-Remote-work-yays-and-nays %}) better to organize, if possible, funny, team building events and to allow for informal, synchronous work when necessary.

## How do people reach out to each others if they need help?

Having a remote journal for communicating between team members doesn't mean that it should be the only way to do so.

In my team we often relied on the remote journal for asking for help.

Having a request for help written black on white (or white on black for those with a dark theme) made more difficult to slack off it and continue on one's own work.

Having a daily update proved to be frequent enough to not let people frustrated with, for example, a pull request to review.

But if for any reason one needed help ASAP, the chat is always there for it and no-one really played ghost in it.

I've been told that in the dailies, there's the good point of "one talks and the others listen" that makes it easier to call for help.

I don't believe in that, but even if so, after my experience, I'd add "...but with remote journal, one writes and the others read. And they can't pretend to have missed the message"

## Do you need a reminder for compiling the journal?

It was a concern of mine at the beginning, and I had setup an automatic reminder at the beginning of the day asking to fill the journal.

Truth is, my team-mates and I always filled the journal way before the reminder so the solution came to be to a non-problem.

Personally I've appreciated the journal as the first thing to do in my working day, it helped to order my ideas and wrap up, with a fresh mind, what I did the time before.

It became a positive, solid habit and I like to think that it was the same also with my mates.

## How do you ensure that people read the journal after they compiled it?

- I think the information is useful and can be read and re-read at any moment, so you don't need to push people to read the journal

## Unexpected advantages

- Helps with code review
- Sharing with management
- Works for giving a picture of the state of the team and "taking the pulse"
