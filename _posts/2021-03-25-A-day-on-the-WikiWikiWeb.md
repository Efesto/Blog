title: "A day on the WikiWikiWeb"
---

Today I spent a good chunk of my day reading articles on [WikiWikiWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb), the first Wiki ever.

Here some of the ones that mostly resonated with me:

> "You can ChangeYourOrganization or ChangeYourOrganization." -- MartinFowler

* [The excellent diary from James Shore](https://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganizationDiary) on how to bring XP in a non-agile organisation, pairs well with 
[Tactics](https://wiki.c2.com/?ChangeYourOrganizationTactics)

> "Management puts you in a tank. You stay in that tank. Life is an illusion. Management is an illusion. Once you realize this, you can jump twenty feet in the air, dodge bullets, and generally Get Things Done."

* [The perilious Matrix Management](https://wiki.c2.com/?MatrixManagement) that is reflected by the existence of so many staff engineers and Product-something

> It is easy for other people to recognize a ChronicComplainer, but the complainers don't recognize themselves as such.

* The brutal honesty of [Chronic complainer](https://wiki.c2.com/?ChronicComplainer)

* A simple view point of what I used to call "the coffee machine communication" in [SerendipitousCommunication](https://wiki.c2.com/?SerendipitousCommunication)
* How certain terms used in the industry have started being adopted like [SilverBullet](https://wiki.c2.com/?SilverBullet)

I suggest any person interested in Agile methodologies and/or Extreme Programming to have a ride on this ideas train and breath some of the good stuff that yield to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), which is still one of the best things that happened in the way of conceiving our profession.
