title: "team smells"

This is my second post about development teams and the problems I've spotted by working with various of them. [This is the first](/blog/2021/11/19/How-to-team.html)

In this one, I wanted to be more pragmatic than in the previous and try to identify some team smells.

The term "team smell" is a deliberate homage to "[Code Smell](http://wiki.c2.com/?CodeSmell)" of agile memory.

These are just possible symptoms and maybe some situations are indeed exceptional or there's a legit reason behind.

I want to call the attention on these patterns and in some situation are part of the daily life. I hope that this post will help someone to realize her/his situation and push for improving it.

## Team smells
### __"Overcrowded meeting"__ or __"Sorry, I wasn't listening"__
This usually happens when the team is composed by more than 5 people that need to communicate together constantly, communication is slow, and information is lost. 

A small team is an efficient team and growing it will mostly make it slower and less productive.

This could be a symptom of a management desire to increase productivity. Any tech knows that it's instead the "9 women can't deliver a baby in 1 month" problem.

In remote working could be called the __"Too many squares in this call"__ smell

### __"The smell of New Old Project in the morning"__
When most of the team members are mostly new-joiners on a project that is stable and maintained, it could be a symptom of high churn rate and team unhappiness. Maybe also of the whole organization.

### __"Deploy and run"__ or __"I'll write a bug ticket for it"__
A team that "deploys and runs" is not responsible for its bugs and its project deployment. It could mean a cluttered pipeline, a misunderstood definition of done, and tolerance for an unstable, unreliable system.

It could hide "delivery rush" and "feature creep" and everything that pushes "always forward".

### __"All good for me"__
This smell is perceivable when, during project-related meetings, most people don't have anything to say or any question. It could hide a blaming mentality and people might not feel comfortable in sharing their opinion or their unknowns, impeding the discovery process.

### __"Rushy dailies"__
Since I remember, the most effective dailies were the ones with the fewest rules. 

Dailies have to be informal and should be effective, short meeting for syncing everyone on what's going on in the team.
The ritual itself could be a waste of time if the team uses other means to communicate its state and this could be a symptom that is imposed by someone else.

What would happen if your team decides that the daily is useless?

### __"I want this technology"__ or __"Put me this a/b test tag here"__
This happens when a team is requested to implement specific technologies without being consulted first and without knowing why. 

The reason could be related to a "always yes" attitude of the team to accept any ticket is given, but also to an established wrong way of collaboration between client and team itself.

### __"Could you write a ticket for us?"__ or __"F***ing Jira"__
Tickets are a way to represent a desire and to define a minimal unit of delivery. 

Some tickets could also come from the team itself as a way to give visibility to its process and plan it.

Delegating the tickets writing to a third party outside the team could hide the incapability to contribute to its activities or express its needs. 

As someone told me, it's the "Alienation of labor".

### __"It's red, it's fine"__ or __"We usually don't care for that test"__
If a team works with a CI and that includes a suite of tests which are always or often failing, this could mean that the team is not free to fix or removing them. 

This could hide a top-down influence on the tools and the ways that the team uses for getting feedback of its work or a lack of knowledge for maintaining them.

Like using a tool without knowing how.
  
### __"I just picked it from the top of the backlog"__ or __"I don't know what to do next"__
If a team doesn't have knowledge of its backlog could be that it doesn't know what is working on and why. Knowledge is fundamental for the effectiveness of a team and also being able to decide what makes sense and what doesn't.
