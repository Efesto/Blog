I like working remotely.

And I can't imagine going back to work exclusively in-place, that's something that doesn't make any sense to me.

But not everything is perfect and of course for the YAYs that working remotely brings, there are also some NAYs.

## YAYs

### My life, my time

I'm feeling like spending time for doing something, sometimes useful, and not only for being somewhere and being paid for it, or being controlled.

Also, I feel that my daughter is growing next to me and not just during the time I'm home from the office.

Working from home makes me feel like to be part of the family and that my work comes after, not the reverse.

### Lunchtime

Preparing my food and taking a real break for lunch it's a pleasure and helps detach.

Even better if I can do it with my family; and if at any time I want to have lunch outside, I don't need to necessarily stick in the office neighborhood so that I can be back in time for whatever.

### My perfect desk

I love my desk, I have the perfect amount of screens: My Mac's, my main screen in landscape and the one in portrait on the side, the keyboard I want, and everything else I can wish for.

I don't have to ask any office management for anything.

### No commuting time

In my first job, I used to commute around 40 mins each way by bus. When I didn't have to commute 2 hours by car.

With time I've learned to leverage that time by reading, listening to music, or simply sleeping.

I'm happy that I don't need to do that anymore and I have control of that time.

### Working from anywhere

Even tho I'm affectionate to my space, I love the opportunity of being able to work from almost wherever I want at any time. It's another thing that makes me feel that is not my job controlling my life but the reverse.

## NAYs

### Not so many humans

It's almost impossible to create connections with colleagues, and even less friendships.

Everyone tends to stay in his remote work bubble, fully focusing or taking care of his life, and creating connections in the workplace becomes a secondary aspect.

Some of the nicest people that I have the luck to call friends are from my first job, and even if for sure being younger played a big factor in creating these connections, for sure also sharing time in the same place did.

And let go of any initiative for creating connections in a remote environment, I think zoom Christmas parties are dystopia's material.

### Real-time meetings

Unfortunately or for good, synchronous meetings are still a necessary tool for collaboration, and being used to a fully remote environment makes them feel even more demanding and less appealing.

### No bike commuting time

If commuting for long periods can be horrible, living in a big, flat, and bike-safe city allows commuting by bike for a decent amount of time.

Is a nice way to keep yourself in shape without requiring too much willpower. That's something that I miss.

### Work-time/free-time separation

It's difficult to fully separate from work if you don't have a dedicated working space

Even harder if the space that you use for work is also used for your hobbies; then it's when you start dreaming of unrealistic living places.
