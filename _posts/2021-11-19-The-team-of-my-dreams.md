title: "The team of my dreams"
---

- Takes care of himself
  - Values its independence
    - Iterates and improves its process autonomously
  - Doesn't work as a lone wolf
  - Tackles its frustration
- It's honest with its clients/stakeholders and values their trust
  - Does its best to deliver realistically
  - Doesn't hide problems but doesn't use them as an excuse
  - It's open to observation
  - Doesn't commit to external estimations or delivery dates
    - That's not something that the team decided, the team cannot take responsibility for that
- Cares for the stuff it works on
  - Considers quality as an essential part of its daily job
  - Considers quality as a way to gain client trust and frustration prevention
  - Does continuous delivery


## What damages the dream team
- Micromanagement
- Isolation and opacity
  - Not having a way to show its progress
  - Not having visibility of their processes
- Not taking time for sharpening its tools
  - Not discussing internal issues
  - Not tackling frustration
  - Not taking time to study and learn
- Not knowing its velocity
  - Not knowing how big is a change
  - Changing scope, project and people continuosly
- Not being focused on a target, goal, project
  - Communication overhead
  - Having to re-learn the wheel
  - Hacing to re-establishing processes
- Being too focused on a target, goal, project
  - Not seeing the place of the team in the big vision
  - Not understanding the decisions and not being able to react
- Lack of team work
  - Being too many members

## Examples that I've seen in my career
- Delivery dates decided externally to the team and often missed
- Teams with more than 5 developers that had long internal meetings and often different kind of problems internally to the team itself
- Teams committed to different codebases shared between different teams that had to re-discuss quality bringing practices over and over
- Shared codebases that were simply not maintained by anyone specifically and therefor were too complex to manage
- Teams committed to different projects unable to understand any of those precisely
- Teams that had feedback of their work only it reached production
- Teams that never committed to sprints and suffered the sprint scope creep
- Teams doing Scrumban and never understandin fully why


## Tool sharpening
- Like a knife that is a simple tool for doing many things, so the ideal tools for a team should be few, simple and very effective
- A knife requires constant attention in order to cut as new, so with the growing of the complexity that we handle, we should give attention to our tools
