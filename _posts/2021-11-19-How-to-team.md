title: "How to team"
---

In my career I had the chance to change teams and work processes multiple times, and to encounter some tornment on the topic of team working.
Although some of these processes and teams claimed to be agile oriented and with a certain kind of established processes, not all of them were successful in the basic goal of delivering consistently value to their stakeholders and some were inducing some degree of frustration in their members and sometimes in their code.
So I wanted to start a mini series of posts on what I learned so far about "How to team" and how I think a software development team should look like.

## It takes care of itself
This team takes care of itself without expecting someone else external to do it.
Values its independence and improves its way of working autonomously, by using ingenuity and any other instrument necessary to improve itself.
Such team needs to have a continuous, honest communication on what its important for its members and being ready to let go what is not.

### Some of the blocks that prevents a team from taking care of itself
- Keeping the client and its feedback far from the team slows down the self-improvement cycle
- Having an external team management trying to control the teams' activity
- Periodically splitting the team in order to distribute knowledge
- Imposing tools, practices because "that't the way"

## It's honest with its clients/stakeholders and values their trust
Delivering consistently, reliably and taking care of its artifacts is the money that the team spends for buying the client's trust.
This also means that the team doesn't commit or promise to something that cannot realistically deliver, might be a delivery date or a long term plan, in order to not create expectations that cannot maintain.
This team establishes a contract with its clients that defines how to work with, how to make requests, how to review its job and so on.
Doesn't have to hide its progress or being ashamed of its mistakes.

__It's a team that is open to observation but closed to influences that might damage the effectiveness of its process__

### What makes this difficult
- Not knowing the team's velocity, because it's the only way to not under and overcommit.
- Accepting external estimates, delivery dates or roadmaps
- Having team's management that doesn't consult with the team itself

## Cares for its artifacts
This teams considers quality as something important to every and each of its artifact.
It establishes for itself which parts requires more attention and when the quality is satisfying.
It tries to expose its artifacts to the client as soon as possible and receives and considers feedback in the same fashion.

__Tackles the creative process frustration and sharpen the tools of its art for preventing it__

### When this doesn't happen
- When the team shares its workspace/codebase with too many different teams/individuals, which could bring lack of sense of ownership.
- When the team doesn't take ownership of the delivery.
- If the team is not considered responsible fully for the artifact maintenance.
- The team is rushed towards delivery and is not trusted in its estimations

These to me are the essentials on which everything could be built upon.

I'm aware that some of these points are quite general and could fit or being against potentially to any situation, I'll come to something more pragmatic a later post: "Teams Smells".
