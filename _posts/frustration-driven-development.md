title: "Frustration driven developer"
---

I consider myself a Frustration driven developer.
A FDD developer thinks that any system produces a certain amount of frustration during it's maintenance and development operations and this is a direct measure of its overall quality.
Is a builder that doesn't think about scaling until her/his system is first under some sort of stress, until some bottleneck has been filled or some requirement has been defined.

I think that a system that causes frustration to its caretakers is a system that is failing on certain, human-centered metric that is difficult to quantify but which involves a concrete problem for whoever relies on it, in other words, a system that causes frustration is a system that sooner or later will fail the goal(s) for which it has been built.

There's no system that doesn't give a certain dose of frustration, as much as there is no system without bugs, lost knowledge, not fully documented or understandable components and so on.
But that's why frustration is something that needs to be tackled with every action that is taken on the artifact, might be code change, testing or tooling, and that's why I give value in always leave the code that I touched a bit better than how I've found it.

Frustration is a product of a changing system, some systems tend to change more often and require more attention over time, I work in software and my systems tend to change every hour or less.


Also a developing team is a system composed by humans and therefor it can also build frustration.
If too many elements in a team need to communicate too often, that's source of frustration, maybe also that is a system that has been built for scaling before having the need to.
Changes in such a system require time to be tested and to stabilize, not differently from a technological one, because people need to develop trust and understandment.
A team too big for too less work or not well distribuited is a system that fails in controlling frustration.

In conclusion:
For me reducing frustration is a driver in my developing, as something that "the least, the best".
Can be considered a metric, hard to measure but important to consider, that has a concrete effect on the maintenance and development of a system.
The more the system evolves and changes, the more is important to keep frustration under control.
