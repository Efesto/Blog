title: "Frustration driven development"
---

- An aspect that is often under considered in our industry is the "frustration factor"
- Directly correlated to how difficult is to work on a certain codebase
- Correlated to the number of elements that must communicate
- Not measurable, but this doesn't mean that should not be considered, like overall happiness
- Correlated to missing automation (SRE book)
- Complexity increase without incrementality contributes to it
- Driver for team size and architecture
- Something to do with microservices out of the box
- Churn rate is directly connected
- Frustration is directly correlated to system control and confidence
- Frustration must emerge as a retrospective output
- The scout rule

Take aways
- Consider frustration together with mainteinability when designing architectures
- Doesn't exist code without frustration
- Embrace frustration as a way to improvement
- What source of frustration can you spot in your day-to-day work?
