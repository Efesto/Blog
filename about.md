Hello, I'm __Marco Polita__, and this is my manual.
The idea and the realization has been inspired by [Manual of me](https://my.manualof.me) and [Jamie Tanna's manual](https://manual.jvt.me/)


## If I came with a warning label, it would say...
Warning: contains Natural Scepticism™

## My personality type is...
<div class="mbticode">INTP</div>

> _A Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity_

## I work best when...
I'm given autonomy. When I'm coding I do my best to reach the flow which could also mean that I'm not reachable at all for some hours.

In order to have that I need not only to know the _what_ but also the _why_ I'm doing something so I am totally free to define the _how_

Also I give my best when I'm part of a passionate, smart and motivated team that can take care of itself.

I've wrote about that in [How to team](https://www.marcopolita.me/blog/2021/11/19/How-to-team.html) and [Frustration driven developer](https://www.marcopolita.me/blog/2021/02/06/frustration-driven-developer.html)

## What motivates me to come into work each day is...
Knowing that I'll learn something new by building or fixing something.

## Feedback is best given...
I like receiving honest and direct feedback from the people I'm closely working with.
I appreciate the feedback in written form so I can refer to later for improvement but I appreciate also discussing issues face-to-face.

## I add value to a team by...
- Proposing and considering solutions out of the beaten path
- Pushing and contributing to shortening the communication chain
- Delivering fast and removing friction
- Recognizing frustration and working for removing it

## The environments in which I thrive...
- Have short communication chains
- Value individual and team autonomy
- Allow for honest and straightforward feedback
- Are not formal for the sake of it
- are open to change and value agility (without uppercase 'A')

## Beyond work, I’m really passionate about...
- Computer games, I'm an avid [Hunt: Showdown](https://www.huntshowdown.com/) player
- Books, both fictionous and non-fictionous
- Movies, almost any genre
- Bouldering
